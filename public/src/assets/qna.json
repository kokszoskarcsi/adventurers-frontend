      "key": "1",
      "a": "A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that operates on blockchain technology, allowing for democratic decision-making processes and enabling members to collectively make decisions and allocate resources."
    },
    {
      "key": "2",
      "a": "Yes. We created the first Discord verification bot and made a game, where you could train, level up, PvP, and play against everyone in a rumble royale-style game. It has outgrown what Discord can offer, and now we are working on a fully web-based experience with a dApp connector."
    },
    {
      "key": "3",
      "a": "Ergo is a next-generation smart contract platform that ensures the economic freedom of ordinary people through secure, accessible, and decentralized financial tools. We chose this blockchain because: 1) True decentralization is important for us. 2) Interesting benefits over competitors. 3) Huge potential, as in my opinion both the community and the chain are currently in their 'pre-network effect' era and opportunities are still untapped."

    {
      "key": "4",
      "a": "This is our governance token - members can use it to vote on proposals on-chain. Total supply = 25.000.000 (100%) Airdrops = 20.000.000 (80%) As you can see, most of the tokens will be airdropped to Adventurer NFT holders. Each Adventurer will receive 100.000 $OBSIDIAN tokens once, and there will be 200 Adventurer NFTs in total. (We might release different collections in the future with different utilities, but that is not the topic of this temperature check.) Rewards = 1.000.000 (4%) This category gives us some room for new ideas - these tokens will be rewarded to those who contribute to the life of the DAO in some outstanding way. Liquidity = 4.000.000 (16%) These tokens will be used to create an LP pool on Spectrum DEX. Half of the tokens will be sold in private rounds to raise the $ERG needed to create the LP pair. At the start, only a portion of this will be sold, and liquidity will be added continuously. It will be sold at a price that does not dilute the $OBSIDIAN price. Every $OBSIDIAN token not yet distributed will be held in a treasury wallet, and will not be used in any way."
